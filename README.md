### The Rules:

- When you start the game, a random word will be generated, and it will be displayed with blanked out letters
- You need to guess the letters of the word, one at a time
- If you make a wrong guess, then the hangman picture will start to be drawn
- You are allowed 9 wrong guesses. On the 10th wrong guess, the picture will be complete and you will lose!
- If you manage to guess the word without making 10 wrong guesses, then you will win!
